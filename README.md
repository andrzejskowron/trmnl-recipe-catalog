# TRMNL Recipe Catalog
A community-driven catalog of public repositories containing recipes for TRMNL.

The goal of this project is to collect TRMNLP-compatible recipes in repositories and make them available as a catalog for BYOS. Since the official recipe catalog sources are currently not public, this project is intended to serve as an alternative.
