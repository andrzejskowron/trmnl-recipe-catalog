# TRMNL Recipe Catalog
A community-driven catalog of public repositories containing recipes for TRMNL.

The goal is to collect TRMNLP-compatible recipes in repositories and make them available as a catalog for BYOS, so they can be installed automatically. Since the official catalog is currently not publicly available, this is intended to serve as an alternative.
